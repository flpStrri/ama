# [Ask me any question](https://github.com/flpStrri/ama/issues/new)

Following the awesome Mr. @kentcdodds idea, I will keep this repo so I can answer questions and keep the answers public, **If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an [email](mailto:joao+ama@filipestorarri.com) and I can post the question anonymously for you.

By the way, anything means anything. Life; Faith; Meaning; Code; Whatever.

## Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered;
- Use a succinct title and description;
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant repository issues tracker;
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow;
- Be civil and polite;
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

## Disclaimer

All questions are welcome but not all questions will be answered by me. To increase the likelyhood of me answering your question it should:

- Be relevant to me or my opinions in some way and not something anyone could answer (those are better served by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc).
- Be helpful or interesting for other people. I prefer this medium to email because my time spent answering these questions helps more people.

## Other contact mediums
I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/flpstrri) and [email](mailto:joao+ama@filipestorarri.com), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/flpStrri/ama/issues/new).
